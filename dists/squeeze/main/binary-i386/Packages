Description: Load-balanced unspoofable packet switching network
 I2P is an anonymizing network, offering a simple layer that identity-sensitive
 applications can use to securely communicate. All data is wrapped with several
 layers of encryption, and the network is both distributed and dynamic, with no
 trusted parties.
 .
 This package depends on the router, jbigi, the java service wrapper, and
 includes support to run I2P as a daemon.

Description: Java Big Integer library
 This Package contains the libjbigi JNI library (and on x86 platforms, jcpuid).
 .
 libjbigi is a math library that is part of the I2P installation.  Use of this
 library greatly enhances the efficiency of cryptographic algorithms, such as
 the ones used by I2P. You can expect to see a 5-7x speed improvement on certain
 tasks, such as elGamal encryption/decryption.

Description: Jar daemon wrapper (javadoc files)
 The Java Service Wrapper makes very easy to install a Java Application as a
 daemon process on Unix systems. The Wrapper monitors a JVM (Java Virtual
 Machine) process and automatically restarts it if it that the JVM has crashed
 or hung. This process takes just a few seconds once the Wrapper has decided
 there is a problem. It also gives the ability to handle process priority.
 .
 This package contains the javadoc files.
