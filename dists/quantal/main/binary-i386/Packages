Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - Qt GUI
 Anoncoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending. Anoncoin is a fork of Bitcoin.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.
 This requires 200 MB+ of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides Anoncoin-Qt, a GUI for Anoncoin based on Qt.

Description: Jar daemon wrapper (javadoc files)
 The Java Service Wrapper makes very easy to install a Java Application as a
 daemon process on Unix systems. The Wrapper monitors a JVM (Java Virtual
 Machine) process and automatically restarts it if it that the JVM has crashed
 or hung. This process takes just a few seconds once the Wrapper has decided
 there is a problem. It also gives the ability to handle process priority.
 .
 This package contains the javadoc files.
